Thou art more {adj1} and more {adj2}.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of {geographical_location},
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of {mythical_location} shines,
And often is his {precious_gem} complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal {emotion} shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall {zodiac} brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to {physics_concept} thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to {your_name}."""
